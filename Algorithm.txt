Before you begin coding, write an algorithm that represents the steps necessary to play a game of rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock in a 
best-of-three format. By writing out the steps, it will make you think about every piece needed to bring the game to life. Please submit to your
instructor Slack channel once completed for approval to start coding.

Steps;
1: Display the rules of the game. includes how, and what "RPSLS" beats the other. Display how best-out-of-three works.
2: Determine the number of human players. Options are Player vs. Player or Player vs. AI.
3: display that the game is best out of three.
4: Display the options of what "RPSLS"
5: Each player has to choose what object to play.
6: Each play will "shoots" at the same time displaying the chosen object.
7: If the players play the same object, no one wins and the round re-starts.
8: For there the be a round winner one player has to play and object that beats the other.
9: The winner of the round is calculated by what object beats the other object.
10: The winner of the round gets one win added to the total of wins and the next round starts.
11: this continues until there is a winner. 

Options:
rock
paper
scissors
lizard
Spock

rule: 
win-         Lose-
______________________
Rock crushes Scissors  
Scissors cuts Paper 
Paper covers Rock 
Rock crushes Lizard 
Lizard poisons Spock 
Spock smashes Scissors 
Scissors decapitates Lizard 
Lizard eats Paper 
Paper disproves Spock 
Spock vaporizes Rock  

*DO NO HAVE A GESTURES CLASS*

we need to show the rules (with welcome)
determine if pvp or pvai
we need to add players to a game
we need to define the gestures
each user has to pick a gesture, or AI needs to do this randomly
we need to account for bad input for invalad choice
we need to take both inputs and determine who wins, define ex: does rock beat paper?
we need to account for a tie
we need to keep track of wins on each side and compare them to each other
a winner is defined by best of three. meaning the winner has to have for example 2 of three wins. must win by two.
display the winner.

classes needed;
player
human
AI
